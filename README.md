# Croydon_Organisations_CareInTheCommunity
# In this project I am working with Reem Kayyali at Kingston University to create a directory that can be easily updated and managed or
# even better - it might auto update.
# We will begin with the data we from the local community, which is free to share, and which wehave enriched with location and cleaning.
# I will begin by using the tool datadock.io to upload the basic name and location data for the organisations. 
# datadock.io will produce a flat RDF file and save it here, in GitHub
